## üéì PTUK Graduation Project Management System
### üí°Overview
The Graduation Project Management System is designed to facilitate and streamline the process of managing graduation projects for students at our university. It aims to address various challenges faced during the graduation year, such as supervisor allocation, project research, communication issues, and project management.
<br> <br>


### üîçFeatures
#### Supervisor Reservation System
At the beginning of the graduation year, students can use the system to reserve a supervisor. This prevents issues encountered when supervisors become unavailable due to early bookings by other students.
<br/> </br>

#### Project Repository
The system includes a repository of previous graduation projects and assignments. This helps students and supervisors to research and reference past work, ensuring that current projects are original and building upon existing knowledge.
<br/> </br>

#### Communication Tools
Supervisor-Student Chat
A chat feature allows seamless communication between students and their supervisors. This helps in clarifying doubts, discussing project progress, and receiving guidance throughout the project duration.
<br/> </br>

#### ChatBot
An AI-powered chat bot answers frequently asked questions related to graduation projects. It provides instant support and reduces the dependency on manual assistance for common queries.
<br/> </br>


#### Notifications and Alerts
The system sends notifications and alerts regarding assignment deadlines, announcements from the department, and other important updates. This ensures that students and supervisors are informed promptly about their responsibilities and any changes.
<br>

#### Administrative Controls
Department Head Oversight
The head of the department reviews the registration process and manages the allocation of student groups to supervisors. This oversight ensures fairness and efficiency in project supervision.
<br/> </br>

#### Admin Privileges
Administrators have the authority to manage department heads, adding or removing them as necessary. They also oversee the repository of previous projects, maintaining an updated database for reference and research purposes.
<br><br>


#### Implementation Details
The system is implemented as a web-based platform, accessible to both students and faculty members through authentication. It utilizes modern web technologies and integrates AI modules for chat bot functionalities.

#### üöÄ Future Enhancements
Future enhancements to the system may include:

Integration with academic calendars for automated scheduling of project milestones.
Enhanced data analytics for performance tracking and project evaluation.
Expansion of the project repository to include more comprehensive research materials.
